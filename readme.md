# Learning Ember via GitHub notifications app

A simple, unfinished GitHub notifications viewer. Building this to
explore Ember.

## Data

The data's hard-coded real-life JSON from the GitHub notifications API.
No Ember Data.

## Tests

The repo includes specs based on [the Ember integration testing guide by
Jo Liss](https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/452). Using integration
testing only, no unit testing at all, seems to be the canonical answer
for testing Ember apps. I'm not satisfied with that as an ultimate
solution, but I'm looking to flesh out an implementation to be sure I
understand.

## Build

There's no build process here, and in a real app you'd see a build
process which enabled each Handlebars template to live in its own file.
